README and Guidelines for Collaborators/Devleopers
===================
Version 1.0
===================

This file contains the guidelines for the Developers/Collaborators of the "minecraft-login-api" repository.

Do's:

  * Always write a commitment description, when editing, removing or oploading something.
  
  * Always use the standard versioning system.
  
  * Always make sure your code is tested, secure, and without errors.

Don'ts:

  * When coding, do not use any other language than english, as the code has to be easy to understand.
  

More will be added soon.

This is currently the first version,
and may be rewritten or removed numerous times, before being completed.
