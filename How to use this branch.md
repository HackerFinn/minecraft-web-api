How to use the feature testing branch.
======================================
  
This branch is for testing new features, before merging with the development branch.

New features should only be merged in here, if they have been accepted in the discussion branch.

Any new features should have their own subdirectory, in the directory that matches the project,  
just like the following: (Feature testing branch)"minecraft-web-api\WordPress\Name of feature\"
