* How to use the discussion branch *

This branch is meant to be a place to propose new features.
To propose a feature, create a new folder and a new file inside it.
Name the folder acording to your proposal.

Inside the file, you can write about your proposal, and maybe write some sample code.

If/when the proposal is accepted, it will be merged into the newfeaturestesting branch.

After ended coding, and testing, it will, be merged with the development branch, and eventually the master branch.
