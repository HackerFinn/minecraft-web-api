Minecraft Web API (minecraft-web-api)
===================

An unofficial PHP-based Minecraft web API for websites.  
This API provides several functions like logging in through the official Minecraft(TM) login servers,  
with official Minecraft(TM) and Mojang(TM) accounts. It will also be able to skins and the like from minecraft.net.
This code is released free of charge, but only for non-commercial use, similar to the GNU GPL license.  
We are yet to choose a specific license, but when we do, it will apply to all current,  
future and previous versions unless we change our minds.  
  
This coding project was started by Lartsch and HackerFinn(Martin Finnerup), and they are the current developers.
